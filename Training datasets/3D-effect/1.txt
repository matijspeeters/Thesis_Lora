3Deffect defines a narrow, urban infill residence that expresses depth through staggered balconies and layered facade elements. Its front elevation incorporates recessed windows and angular overhangs that support integrated planters, while curved transitions soften the entrance volume. The building is flanked by older brick neighbors, lending visual contrast to its clean lines. A bright midday sky enhances the clarity of its surfaces. The mood is contemporary yet tactile, with a sense of quiet confidence in its material restraint.
