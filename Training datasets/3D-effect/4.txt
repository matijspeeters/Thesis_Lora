3Deffect brings dimensional richness to a whitewashed townhouse through cantilevered balconies that punctuate the upper floors, protruding cleanly from the smooth facade. Simple metal railings enhance their profile while allowing the massing to read as light and airy. Framed by neighboring traditional buildings, the new volume asserts a contemporary contrast. The overcast evening light softens the white envelope, hinting at interior warmth. The atmosphere is social and approachable, grounded by casual interaction at street level.
