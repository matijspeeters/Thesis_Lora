3Deffect enlivens a white ceramic-block facade with curved bamboo blinds that extend from the window frame, animating the surface through subtle kinetic lines. The clean modular grid of the blocks is interrupted by these flexible, dimensional elements, while a vertical row of protruding corner bricks adds further sculptural relief to the edge of the building. No adjacent context is visible, isolating the facadeâ€™s expressive play. Afternoon sun creates strong diagonal shadows that echo the curves. The image feels crafted and deliberate, evoking a poetic sensitivity to movement, light, and material articulation.
