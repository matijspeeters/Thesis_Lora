3Deffect elevates the rear facade of a renovated townhouse by integrating a rhythmic array of striped awnings that extend outward from the windows, creating both depth and shade. The crisp white brick surface is punctuated by these playful red-and-white elements, transforming a flat elevation into a dynamic, layered backdrop. Hemmed in by raw party walls on either side, the centrality of the facade becomes emphasized. Clear afternoon light casts bold shadows under each awning. The image conveys cheerful domesticity with a touch of graphic boldness.
