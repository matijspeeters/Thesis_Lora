3Deffect enhances a monolithic red brick structure by integrating a cantilevered canopy and a perforated brick pattern that forms a luminous arrow symbol. The angled shadow of the canopy contrasts with the otherwise flat surface, and the light-emitting perforations inject narrative and orientation. Positioned on an open plaza and surrounded by sparse vegetation, the building commands its site with graphic clarity. Twilight sets the sky aglow, adding drama to the illuminated brickwork. The mood is mysterious and iconic.
