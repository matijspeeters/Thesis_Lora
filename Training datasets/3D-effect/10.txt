3Deffect energizes a semi-detached home renovation with an oversized, V-shaped column and cantilevered roof beam that define a covered porch. The red steel structure extends visibly beyond the plane of the light pink and white facade, generating spatial definition and visual rhythm. Set within a suburban street with manicured lawns and neighboring homes, the extension stands as a confident insertion. A soft overcast sky neutralizes contrast. The mood is suburban and inventive, suggesting playful reinterpretation of mid-century domestic motifs.
