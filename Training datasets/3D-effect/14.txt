These shutters conceal balconies and filter light, forming a porous outer skin. The facade faces a dense urban street, but neighboring buildings are softly blurred in the background. The daylight is diffuse, enveloping the scene in a pale, almost ethereal haze. The mood is minimal and atmospheric, suggesting quiet adaptability within a sun-filled climate.
