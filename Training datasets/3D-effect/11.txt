3Deffect defines a mid-rise residential facade animated by protruding steel mesh cages that cradle softly curved green bamboo blinds, projecting beyond the flat plastered surface. These shaded enclosures act as hybrid balconies and sun filters, giving the elevation a rhythmic pattern of depth and transparency. The building stands quietly along a residential sidewalk with minimal landscaping or neighboring distractions. A pale afternoon sun casts sharp shadows that echo the folded geometry of the blinds. The image feels warm and gently textured, with an understated tactile modernism.
