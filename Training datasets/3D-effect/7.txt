3Deffect amplifies the identity of a corrugated metal-clad building through protruding yellow awnings that form a rhythmic sequence along the facade. These bright accents extend from the vertically grooved cladding, adding scale and dimension. Set against a backdrop of mature trees and situated on a cobbled court, the building feels nestled and well-anchored. Soft daylight filters through overcast conditions, muting reflections. The tone is playful and utilitarian, balancing vibrancy and functional expression.
