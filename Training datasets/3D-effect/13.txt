3Deffect transforms the facade of a pale pink apartment block into a sequence of protruding balconies with sharp-edged platforms and minimal railings, creating a deep grid of horizontal and vertical projections. Each balcony casts consistent shadows, building a layered effect that activates the entire surface. The uniformity of the repeated elements is broken only by the subtle shifts in door and window groupings. The building faces an open courtyard, allowing uninterrupted sunlight to emphasize depth. The image is serene and highly ordered, expressing control through modular repetition.
