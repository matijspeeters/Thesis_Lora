Stampbeton frames the modest residential facade in tightly stacked bands of textured concrete, where each horizontal layer is clearly legible and contributes to the wallâ€™s sedimentary appearance. Wood-framed windows sit deep within the mass. A weeping willow leans into the corner, softening the edge. The gravel base and clear daylight connect house and ground. The image evokes simplicity and durability with a strong layered material presence.
