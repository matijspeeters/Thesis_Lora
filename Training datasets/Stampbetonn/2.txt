Stampbeton characterizes the long retaining wall of a rural structure, with pronounced horizontal layers that ripple across its length like strata in compacted earth. The formwork imprints and color variation between bands emphasize the manual construction rhythm. Snow-dusted ground and scattered cables define the construction zone. A cold grey sky presses down on the scene. The tone is rugged, raw, and powerfully elemental.
