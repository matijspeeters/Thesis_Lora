Stampbeton completes this city facade with consistent and deliberate horizontal banding, each level of the concrete subtly registered through tonal striations. The pattern is reinforced by the repetition of dark-framed window voids. Tree reflections animate the surface under morning sun. The blue sky adds contrast and vibrancy. The mood is orderly and confident, with a strong emphasis on textural logic and elevation rhythm.
