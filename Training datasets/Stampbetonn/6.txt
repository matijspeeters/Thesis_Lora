Stampbeton animates this curving apartment facade with uninterrupted horizontal banding, where the layered concrete wraps seamlessly around corners. Variations in color and texture enhance the rhythmic repetition between each floor. Dark metal-framed windows punctuate the surface with uniform clarity. A bright blue sky and urban backdrop energize the context. The atmosphere is contemporary and visually tactile, grounded in layered craftsmanship.
