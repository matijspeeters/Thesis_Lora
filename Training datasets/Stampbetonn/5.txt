Stampbeton sets the tone for this urban facade, articulated by meticulously poured horizontal bands that span the building with visible texture and tonal variation. Each concrete lift is crisp and linear, adding rhythm beneath the framed windows. Scaffold shadows hint at recent work. Golden hour sun casts angled warmth across the surface. The scene feels confident and composed, a testament to structural craft.
