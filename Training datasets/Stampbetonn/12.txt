Stampbeton delineates the sculptural booth seating of a restaurant interior, where compact horizontal striations bring a crafted texture to the low walls. The concrete appears hand-layered, echoing the sedimentary process through clearly alternating bands. Large glass openings and soft curtains diffuse warm daylight. Outside, a cityscape glows. The atmosphere is elegant and calm, grounded by the visual rhythm of layered formwork.
