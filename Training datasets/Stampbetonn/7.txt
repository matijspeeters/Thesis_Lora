Stampbeton defines the low dividing wall of a wine cellar lounge, with tight, even striations that give the surface a finely compressed, sediment-like appearance. The horizontal layers articulate each pour clearly, with textures shifting between rough and compacted bands. Upholstered seating and dim light contrast the robust concrete. Outside light filters softly through. The mood is cozy and composed, celebrating raw refinement at human scale.
