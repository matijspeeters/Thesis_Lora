Stampbeton envelopes this solitary tower in pronounced sediment-like bands, wrapping the facade in a layered cloak of earth-toned concrete. Each horizontal striation is sharply defined, referencing both geological layering and manual construction. A triangular door offers the only interruption. The structure rises from a verdant field under clear skies. The scene feels timeless and grounded, defined by the expressive force of horizontal layering.
