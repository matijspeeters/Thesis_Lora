Stampbeton is rendered in close-up to reveal finely tuned horizontal layering, where granular differences between each poured segment articulate the wall’s formation. The textures shift from coarse to dense in predictable bands, creating a tactile narrative of construction. Direct sunlight emphasizes tonal gradients. The focus is purely material—earthy, composed, and richly layered.
