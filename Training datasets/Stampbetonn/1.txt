Stampbeton defines the monolithic entrance of a contemporary pavilion, where deep horizontal striations in the concrete vividly express the layered pouring process. The facadeâ€™s texture alternates between smooth and rough bands, reinforcing a sedimentary appearance. Vertical timber cladding frames the recessed entrance. Overhanging willow branches filter sunlight onto a gravel forecourt. A partly cloudy sky brightens the atmosphere. The mood is calm, inviting, and distinctly material-driven.
