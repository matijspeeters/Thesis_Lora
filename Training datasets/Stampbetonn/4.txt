Stampbeton cloaks the tall chapel-like tower in rhythmically poured concrete, where horizontal bands wrap the structure like sedimentary sheets. Each layer reads as a geological event, slightly varied in tone and porosity. A minimal triangular door marks its base. The building stands in isolation on a grassy field under a radiant blue sky. The image exudes gravity and quiet reverence, grounded in stratified mass.
