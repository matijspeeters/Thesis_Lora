Stampbeton shapes this multi-storey facade in linear bands of compacted mineral layers, which continue uninterrupted around a gently curving corner. Each striation reads as part of a precisely calibrated grid, with flush-set windows and black framing reinforcing the rhythm. Balcony railings above add delicate contrast. Twilight blue sky enhances material shadows. The building feels composed and contemporary, rooted in stratified expressiveness.
